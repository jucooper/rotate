# Rotate
A ruby app that 'rotates' my Rocket League clips to my gfycat profile.

## Usage

```

```
Scrapes http://xboxdvr.com/ for my clips that were posted within the days specified and uploads those clips to my gfycat profile. 

In this example, I'm scraping the xbox clips that were recorded within 3 days.
